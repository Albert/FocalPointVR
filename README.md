Version history
---------------
Version 1.0.0 - Accepted and in asset store
Version 0.0.0 - First pass -- as the sole developer I'll keep this at 0.0.0 until other people depend on it or Unity accepts the asset, at which point I'll tag it at 1.0.  I will be submitting it to the asset store shortly.
